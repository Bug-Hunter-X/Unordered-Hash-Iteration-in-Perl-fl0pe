This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl related to hash iteration order.  Perl does not guarantee the order of keys when iterating through a hash. The `bug.pl` file shows how this can lead to unexpected results. The `bugSolution.pl` demonstrates a solution using `sort` to ensure predictable output.
